## Unsupervised Learning
- [Choice, happiness and spagetti sauce](https://www.ted.com/talks/malcolm_gladwell_on_spaghetti_sauce?language=en): "Tipping Point" author Malcolm Gladwell gets inside the food industry's pursuit of the perfect spaghetti sauce -- and makes a larger argument about the nature of choice and happiness.

### Principal Component Analysis
- [Principal Component Analysis - Explained Visually](http://setosa.io/ev/principal-component-analysis/): Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique used to emphasize variation and bring out strong patterns in a dataset. It's often used to make data easy to explore and visualize.

## Supervised Learning
- [Random Forests vs Gradient Boosting Machines](https://medium.com/@aravanshad/gradient-boosting-versus-random-forest-cfa3fa8f0d80)

- [XGBoost](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/rfp0697-chenAemb.pdf): XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient, flexible and portable. It implements machine learning algorithms under the Gradient Boosting framework. XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solve many data science problems in a fast and accurate way. The same code runs on major distributed environment (Hadoop, SGE, MPI) and can solve problems beyond billions of examples.
